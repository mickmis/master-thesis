% not just summary: insightful conclusion

\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item additional pic-sure resources: HAIL, ODSY OMOP
    \item for HAIL: the R connector through PIC-SURE, work of Denise
    \item missing features: query saving, data extraction
\end{itemize}

% HAIL / R / PIC-SURE: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29267850
% checkout/mention more general systems: scidb / elasticsearch / olap-mdx (mdx is the query language, olap the model)-could be envisioned to be supported thorgh pic sure --> go to future work

% add blockchain auth (gb)
% add PIC-SURE generic query in gb to be able to use other kind of data source
% add shrine

from wardo:
% ======== evaluation how impl. met 
Next steps:
- Building out a wider set of functionality
- Support tranSMART via PIC-SURE API or PIC-SURE and tranSMART API at the same time
- Allowing multiple PIC-SURE data sources to be connected at the same time
- Allowing to ask questions on multiple data-sources at the same time - Refer to work of Denise and Jeremy, connecting Hail + Livy and i2b2 or tranSMART at the same time.
- Comment on connecting non-i2b2 based data sources (eg Hail)
