% things that could be used to solve our problem as a whole (this is different form technological choices!)
% split related in 2 for the 2 objectives: this makes sense because they are relatively different
\begin{itemize}
    \item l-i2b2-facade + l-i2b2-shrine
    \item other approaches to medical data browsing?
    \item SHRINE
    \item privacy-preserving solutions?

% [7:33 PM] Ward Weistra: @FlorianGuitton is also on Hipchat here
% [10:16 PM] Ward Weistra: Florian (Imperial College) on the question whether the list you found were the supported data sources:
% [10:16 PM] Ward Weistra:
%     |  [7:41 PM] Florian Guitton: Yes, those are the ones here. Additionnaly we are looking at Stata and Icometrix, but those are not present on the repo yet.
%     |  [7:41 PM] Florian Guitton: As you can see here : https://github.com/dsi-icl/borderline-middleware/blob/master/src/core/queryObject_TS17_1.js#L329-L33...
%     |  [7:42 PM] Florian Guitton: We are not applying any transformation to the transmart API at this point in time
%     |  [7:42 PM] Florian Guitton: and are simply "proxifying"
%     |  [7:42 PM] Florian Guitton: the authentication, query, polling, update, result extraction is managed by the middleware as well
%     |  [7:43 PM] Florian Guitton: the borderline-server manages the workflow, stepping, queries, users and health of the cluster
%     |  [7:44 PM] Florian Guitton: it defers queries to a middleware picked in a pool based on some logic.
%     |  [7:46 PM] Florian Guitton: data once extracted is loaded into a swift object store and "moved arround" simply by passing ids to it's location to things like the eAE or XNAT docker pipelines
%     |  [7:47 PM] Florian Guitton: Word of caution however, as I said it is very much a work in progress, and while is behaves according to our unit tests, there are no garantee at this point and some concerns have been defferred to later work
% [10:17 PM] Ward Weistra: That link was https://github.com/dsi-icl/borderline-middleware/blob/master/src/core/queryObject_TS17_1.js#L329-L33...

% borderline
% \emph{Borderline} is a set of components implemented in Javascript, including a user interface, that allows to create and execute queries against clinical research platforms.
% Compared to the others, it is a more serious candidate. It is web-based, modern and supports tranSMART, with plans to support i2b2 as well.
% However it is at the time of this project in a work-in-progress state, under heavy development, thus not yet stable.
% Additionally it does not support API translation, only some kind of API proxying.
% For those reason we choose not to retain this solution.
