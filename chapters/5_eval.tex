\chapter{System Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item goals: meet the requirements
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments}
% todo: overhead compared to orig GB

% - questions to be answered: overhead of this new implementation + security of the whole system
% - exp. setup
% - experiments
% - summary

\begin{itemize}
    \item i2b2 query times vs picsure+i2b2 query times (overhead)
    \item medco query times with pic-sure vs previously with shrine (refer to the paper)
\end{itemize}

\section{Security Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item security analysis (how?), incl. thread model
\end{itemize}

% - : i2b2 pws in clear in xml changed 
% where are other problems?
% how to do an analysis: cehck out owasp?
% threats models: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Guide_Introduction#Threat_Modeling
% https://www.owasp.org/images/1/19/OTGv4.pdf

% (incl. medco threat model in there)
% have zones for data and such
% including communications, systems

% authorizations


\section{Requirements Fulfillment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item take list of requirements and summarize how they are met
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item limitations
\end{itemize}
