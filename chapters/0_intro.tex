Intro
Goal: transmart 17.1 - i2b2 - medco (nice to have: shrine, transmart prev. Ver.)
splitted up in 2 obj.
Why open-source

goal: common - privacy preserving

§ the motivation
% todo: get inspiration from papers

§ the goal

These characteristics define two main objectives to fulfill. 
First, the front end in question will need to be able to communicate with the main open-source several clinical research platforms, to cover a major part of the platforms used by researchers.
Second, the front end , namely MedCo, the only privacy-preserving platform.
% todo: in the analyses of what are the platforms, mention what they are

--> focus on cohort exploration

\section{Solution Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}
- about how we want compatibility with the major open-source clinical research systems
% in CCL: put how the requirements are met 
- use of apis standard to easily integrate with others
- unique front end to exploit several back ends: main open-source ones
