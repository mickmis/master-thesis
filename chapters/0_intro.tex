7 Paper outline

Intro
Goal: transmart 17.1 - i2b2 - medco (nice to have: shrine, transmart prev. Ver.)
splitted up in 2 obj.
Why open-source

goal: common - privacy preserving

ยง the motivation
% todo: get inspiration from papers

ยง the goal

These characteristics define two main objectives to fulfill. 
First, the front end in question will need to be able to communicate with the main open-source several clinical research platforms, to cover a major part of the platforms used by researchers.
Second, the front end , namely MedCo, the only privacy-preserving platform.
% todo: in the analyses of what are the platforms, mention what they are

--> focus on cohort exploration

\section{Solution Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}
- about how we want compatibility with the major open-source clinical research systems
% in CCL: put how the requirements are met 
- use of apis standard to easily integrate with others
- unique front end to exploit several back ends: main open-source ones
- support all the features of GB-> not a requirement, consequence of choosing GB//however a list of the UI features we want to have should be present


todo: define first and second objectives (referenced after)

% todo: ack: hyve ,etc.

% todo: if existing solutions are used: those are used by actual users and should not lose features, no change is desired from user p-o-v
