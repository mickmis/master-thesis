\chapter{System Evaluation}

% todo: this section should show how the requirements are met

\begin{itemize}
    \item goals: meet the requirements
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments}
% todo: overhead compared to orig GB

% - questions to be answered: overhead of this new implementation + security of the whole system
% - exp. setup
% - experiments
% - summary

\begin{itemize}
    \item i2b2 query times vs picsure+i2b2 query times (overhead)
    \item medco query times with pic-sure vs previously with shrine (refer to the paper)
    \item experimental setup & methodology
\end{itemize}

% put that or not? see if there is sth to say
\section{Security Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item security analysis
    \item threat model
\end{itemize}

% - : i2b2 pws in clear in xml changed 
% where are other problems?
% how to do an analysis: cehck out owasp?
% threats models: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Guide_Introduction#Threat_Modeling
% https://www.owasp.org/images/1/19/OTGv4.pdf ?

% (incl. medco threat model in there)
% have zones for data and such
% including communications, systems

% authorizations

% need for https comms (proxied here)


\section{Requirements Fulfillment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item take list of requirements and explain how they are met
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item limitations
\end{itemize}

% refering to soft eng requirements:

% % using web apis \ todo: elaborate rest, rephrase
% While these systems may differ, most of them can be queried through RESTful Web APIs.
% Web APIs allows to interact with systems in a platform and technology independent way, by using HTTP calls \cite{todo}.
% RESTful APIs are interfaces that enforce a certain set of constraint (see \cite{todo}) that when used are inducing a number of properties that make their use and programming easier.
% Using RESTful Web APIs contributes to make the system more open and extensible, thus helps meeting the requirements.
