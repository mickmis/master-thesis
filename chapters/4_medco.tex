\section{Detailed Workflow}

\begin{itemize}
    \item medco workflow in steps using glowing bear / pic-sure and no shrine
\end{itemize}

\section{Glowing Bear Query Construction}

assumptions made:
- ontologies match exactly
- authentication: user exists in the 3 pms?


\begin{itemize}
    \item tree browsing, number to encrypt in the tree
    \item same as described before, with a special data type and predicate used
    \item encryption of terms 
    \item format of encrypted terms
\end{itemize}

% gen temporary priv / pub pair of keys for user
% encrypt with group.toml file from config the values to be sent
% decrypt w/ priv key the results

\section{IRCT Query Broadcast}
\begin{itemize}
    \item threads run queries against medco nodes using i2b2 api
\end{itemize}

\section{MedCo Query Processing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item summarize how medco works
    \item modifications made: shrine drop, ?
\end{itemize}

% each ontologiy at each site has 2 ontologies, clear and not clear, explorable by client or not 
% schemas "medconotology" " i2b2metadata_i2b2"

\section{Glowing Bear Result Processing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item format of result
    \item decryption and display
\end{itemize}
